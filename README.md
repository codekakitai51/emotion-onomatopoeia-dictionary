# Emotion Onomatopoeia Dictionary

In this project, I created a single-page application that displays emotions and their corresponding onomatopoeia.
At the top of the page, emotion categories with related images are shown, and at the bottom, each emotion's container section is displayed. 
When a category is clicked, the page jumps to the section containing the onomatopoeia associated with that emotion.

This entire operation is powered by JavaScript.
